# CGIParse

# (lost notes twice!  this time keep file...)
# note - get some examples

# submit simple query
 # (next version - let user map inputs to whole form)

# retrieve results
	# if talking to WG tell it to provide machine-readable results
# get just tags
# if no linebreaks split on <br> or <p> or <tr> tags

# Go thru lines looking for repeats in tags only

#     if find match to prev line, look at next line
#     keep anything more than MIN_REPEAT lines long
#     prefer longest match & if associated content
	# need notes here, was a bit complicated #

# return array of content plus HREF's only
# may be more than one piece of content per hit
# v2 - maybe keep tags and wrap in <table> as needed, otherwise correct html
