t!  I'm going on vacation as it happens tomorrow morning for a week, so some delay on my end, but absolutely I think this is very promising area.

One caveat - I am not a researcher per se, I have a private business and at some point I would probably want to use this type of app on ad-funded sites to gather content.  Of course no problem that the code would be open source, but I wanted to just put this out right off, that I would have a commercial application for it.  I'm also copying Jim Kern who might be a co-collaborator.
